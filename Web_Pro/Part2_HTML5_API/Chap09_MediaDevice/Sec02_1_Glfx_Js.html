				//
				//     image.src = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
				//
				// This has two disadvantages. First, it is much slower, so it
				// would be a bad idea to do this repeatedly. If you are going
				// to be repeatedly updating a filter it's much better to use
				// the <canvas> tag directly. Second, this requires that the
				// image is hosted on the same domain as the script because
				// JavaScript has direct access to the image contents. When the
				// two tags were swapped using the previous method, JavaScript
				// actually doesn't have access to the image contents and this
				// does not violate the same origin policy.
